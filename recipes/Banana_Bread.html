    <img src="./bbread.jpg" height="310" width="310">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Healthy and so delicious, this moist protein banana bread<br> 
       has no sugar and no oil. Unlike other recipes, my protein<br> 
       powder banana bread comes out super soft and moist without<br> 
       drying. <em>15 grams of protein per slice!</em></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>   
    <ul>
        <li>2 ripe banans</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 egg whites</li>
        <li>80 grams greek yogurt</li>
        <li>30 grams nut butter</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>¼ tsp salt</li>
        <li>100 grams oat flour</li>
        <li>50 grams deffated almond flour</li>
        <li> 50 grams protein powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>40 grams chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 170 Cº (340 Fº) and fold a 20 cm (7.9 inches)<br>
            loaf pan with parchment paper or grease with oil.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, mash two ripe bananas with a fork<br>
            until completely smooth. Add to the mixture egg, egg whites,<br>
            Greek yogurt, nut butter, vanilla extract, cinnamon and salt.<br>
            Stir with a whisk or fork for about two minutes, or until all<br>
            is well combined and you get a smooth batter.</li>
        <li>Mix in oat flour, almond flour and baking powder. When the<br>
            flours are incorporated into the wet mixture, scoop in protein<br>
            powder and gently give it a stir. Do not over-mix protein powder.<br>
            Optionally fold in chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan. Bake in hot oven for<br>
            25 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center <br>
            of your protein banana bread comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Remove the banana bread from oven and let cool in the loaf pan for<br>
            a few minutes. Finally, remove from the pan and let cool completely<br>
            before slicing. </li>
    </ol>
