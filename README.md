# odin-recipesV2
This is a second version of the odin-recipes project. It's a new and different project (has nothing to do with V1)

The project conisits of a recipes website. It will have an index page that consists of links towards different recipes pages. Each recipes page will include media (images) and multiple pargraphs and lists describing the recipe, the steps to prepare it and the nutrients that provides.
